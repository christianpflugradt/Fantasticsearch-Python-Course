# An introduction to the Python language #

## Who this course is for ##

This course will teach you the basics of Python. 
It is aimed at developers who are at least familiar with
one other language and know basic concepts of imperative
programming languages.

## What is Python? ##

Python is an imperative, dynamically typed language
that originally came out in 1991 and is still actively developed.
It is especially popular among data scientists
and is my favourite language for scripting and exploratory programming.

Python is a general purpose language, and you can do almost anything with it.

## How this course is structured ##

This is a hands-on course which means you will be writing code. The course is split into three parts.
The first two lessons will be using the Python REPL (read evaluate print loop). If you are using
Linux or Mac Python is probably already installed. Alternatively you could also use an online REPL.

It is recommended to use the latest version of Python 3. You can check your Python version
by executing Python with the ```--version``` flag.

On my Manjaro system the following versions are installed:
```
$ python2 --version
Python 2.7.18
~
$ python --version
Python 3.9.2
~
```

Depending on your operating system if Python is already installed, 
```python``` could point to a Python2 installation in which case
you would have to input ```python3``` (or install it first).

Simply executing Python without any arguments will open the REPL.
You can exit it at any time by inputting ```exit()``` and then pressing enter.

For the third part of the course you will need to write Python code in multiple source code files
so an online REPL will not be sufficient. You do not need an IDE to program in Python,
a text editor is fine enough for small projects.

### Lesson 1 ###

This course will teach you about basic data types and structures in the Python REPL.

Course length: 10 to 30 minutes

### Lesson 2 ###

This course will teach you about functions, objects and control structures.

Course length: 15 to 60 minutes

[Start lesson 2 now](lessons/lesson-2.md)

### Lesson 3 ###

In this lesson you will use several standard libraries of Python
to program a little search engine that can be interacted with through a web interface.

You do not need to install any third party libraries. 
Everything you need comes with the standard installation of Python.

Course Length: 2 to 8 hours
