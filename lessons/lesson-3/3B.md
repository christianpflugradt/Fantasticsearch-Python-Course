# 3B - save and restore database

Difficulty: 2/5

Implement the `save` and `restore` function.

`save` should accept any object/structure as an argument,
serialize it and write it in a file specified by the filename argument.

`restore` should de-serialize the object stored in the file 
specified by the filename argument and return the de-serialized object.

You should use the `pickle` library for (de-)serialization.

## Interface ##

File: [database.py](workspace/database.py)

Function names: `save`, `restore`

Parameters: 
* save: data, filename
* restore: filename

Return value:
* save: none (do not call `return`)
* restore: data (the de-serialized data from the file)

## Tips ##

<details>
  <summary>show tips</summary>

* try to import `pickle` in your REPL, then inspect it with `dir()`
* `dump` is the pickle function to serialize data into a file
* `load` is the pickle function to de-serialize data from a file
* pickle requires a file handle to interact with a file
* `open(filename, mode)` is a built-in method to receive a file handle
* `'wb'` stands for 'write binary' and is a file mode to write binary data into a file
* `'rb'` is the opposite of `wb` and 'r' stands for 'read'
* files should be closed; a file declared as a `with` block will be
  auto-close after the block:
```
with open(filename, mode) as file:
  pass # do smth here
# file is automatically closed now
```

```
from pickle import dump, load # at the top of database.py

def save(data, filename):
    with open(filename, 'wb') as file:
        dump(data, file)
        
def restore(filename):
    with open(filename, 'rb') as file:
        return load(file)
```
