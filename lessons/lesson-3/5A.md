# 5A - implement search engine

Difficulty: 5/5

Implement the ```search``` function.

Search must return all JEPs in the ```jeps``` list
that contain all the search words passed to search function.

Contain means two things here:
* a JEP has a list of tokens, and a search word must be in these tokens
* a search word can be a part (a sub string) of a token to match

If only some search words passed to search function are present in a JEP
it should not be returned from the function.

Example:

Search input ```garbage col``` must match a JEP with these tokens: ```['garbage','collector']```

But input ```garbage col``` must not match a JEP with these tokens: ```['stream','col']```

## Interface ##

File: [searchengine.py](workspace/searchengine.py)

Function name: ```search```

Parameters: a list of search strings

Return value: a list of tuples (id, title) where id is the JEP id (integer) and title (string) the JEP name

## Tips ##

  <summary>show tips</summary>

* you might want to write the algorithm in pseudo code first
* you can ```break``` out of loops
* strings are like lists: ```'yth' in ['python']``` is ```True```  
* ```len()``` is a built-in method to calculate the size/length of an array or dictionary
* ```dictionary.keys()``` will return a set of the dictionary's keys
* ```dictionary[key]``` will return the value from a dictionary
```
a = {b: c}
print(a[b]) # prints value of c
```
* get any key from a dictionary: ```next(iter(dictionary))```
* you can unpack tuples in a for loop: 
```
a = (1,2,3)
for b, c, d in a:
```

```
def search(search_string):
	results = {}
	for word in search_string:
		results[word] = []
		for id, title, tokens in jeps:
			for token in tokens:
				if word.lower() in token:
					results[word].append((id, title))
					break
	merged_results = []
	if len(results) > 0:
		any_result = next(iter(results))
		if any_result is not None:
			for match in results[any_result]:
				found = True
				for collection in results.keys():
					if match not in results[collection]:
						found = False
						break
				if found:
					merged_results.append(match)
	return merged_results
```
